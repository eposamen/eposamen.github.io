				<p>My name is Emilie Posamentier and I am currently completing my second year as a Computer Science Engineer at Tufts University. I am currently proficient in C++ and Python, and will be learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in the spring semester. My interests are highly varied and eclectic. I take great pleasure in just coding for fun, but I also take great pleasure in the arts. I pride myself in my varied passions and believe that all in all, this broad range of passions makes me a better and more creative computer programmer, as well as a more interesting person. My goal is to secure a career where I can comingle creativity and my technical skills, and I believe that as a Computer Sciecne Engineer, I can do just that. </p>
